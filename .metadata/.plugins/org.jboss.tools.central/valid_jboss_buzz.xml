Memcheck is the default tool &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://valgrind.org/"&gt;Valgrind&lt;/a&gt; uses when you don&amp;#8217;t ask it for another tool. Other useful tools you can select (using &lt;code&gt;valgrind tool=&lt;em&gt;toolname&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cachegrind&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;callgrind&lt;/code&gt;, to do cache and call-graph function profiling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;helgrind&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;drd&lt;/code&gt;, to do thread error and data-race detection&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;massif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dhat&lt;/code&gt;, to do dynamic heap usage analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of these tools deserves an article of its own, but here we will concentrate on Memcheck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Detecting memory leaks with Valgrind Memcheck&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memcheck tracks all memory reads, writes, allocations, and deallocations in a C or C++ program. The tool can detect many different memory errors. For instance, it detects reads or writes before or after allocated memory blocks. It warns about the use of (partially) undefined values in conditional code or passing such values to system calls. It will also notify you about bad or double deallocation of memory blocks. But for now, we will discuss memory leak detection with Memcheck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Generating a leak summary&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you run Valgrind on your program without any additional arguments, it produces a summary of the different kinds of leaks it has detected. For example, &lt;code&gt;valgrind ./myprog&lt;/code&gt; might produce the following summary:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; LEAK SUMMARY: definitely lost: 48 bytes in 1 blocks indirectly lost: 24 bytes in 3 blocks possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks still reachable: 14 bytes in 1 blocks suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memcheck reports leaks in five categories: definitely lost, indirectly lost, possibly lost, still reachable, and suppressed. The first four categories indicate different kinds of memory blocks that weren&amp;#8217;t freed before the program ended. If you aren&amp;#8217;t interested in specific blocks, you can tell Valgrind not to report them (you&amp;#8217;ll see how shortly). The summary also shows you the number of bytes lost and how many blocks they are in, which tells you whether you are losing lots of small allocations, or a few large ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following sections explain each category.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Definitely lost&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first category, definitely lost, is generally the most urgent kind of leak to track down, because there is no way to use or recover that memory. Let&amp;#8217;s look at an example of a small program that simply calls &lt;code&gt;output_report&lt;/code&gt; a couple of times. That function prints a small banner and a number each time. As we will see, the memory we reserve for the report banner will be definitely lost (multiple times) when the program finishes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; #include &amp;#60;stdlib.h&amp;#62; #include &amp;#60;stdio.h&amp;#62; #include &amp;#60;string.h&amp;#62; char * create_banner () { const char *user = getenv ("USER"); size_t len = 1 + 2 * 4 + strlen (user) + 1; char *b = malloc (len); sprintf (b, "\t|** %s **|", user); return b; } void output_report (int nr) { char *banner = create_banner (); puts (banner); printf ("Number: %d\n", nr); printf ("\n"); } int main () { for (int i = 1; i &amp;#60;= 3; i++) output_report (i); return 0; } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compile this code with &lt;code&gt;gcc -Wall -g -o definitely definitely.c&lt;/code&gt; and run it under Valgrind, asking for details with &lt;code&gt;valgrind --leak-check=full ./definitely&lt;/code&gt;. Now, before the leak summary, Valgrind will show backtraces where the program allocated memory that was ultimately lost:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; 42 bytes in 3 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1 at 0x4C29F33: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:309) by 0x4011C7: create_banner (definitely.c:10) by 0x401200: output_report (definitely.c:18) by 0x40124C: main (definitely.c:28) &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that Memcheck found three leaks, which it reports as one loss record because they have identical backtraces. By default, it requires the whole backtrace to be the same in order to consider leaks similar enough to report together. If you want Memcheck to combine more leaks, you can use &lt;code&gt;--leak-resolution=low&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--leak-resolution=med&lt;/code&gt; to group leaks that have only two or four backtrace entries in common. This is useful if Memcheck reports lots of leaks with slightly different backtraces that you suspect are probably the same issue. You can then concentrate on the record with the highest number of bytes (or blocks) lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Still reachable&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the previous example, it is clear we should free &lt;code&gt;banner&lt;/code&gt; after use. We could do that at the end of the &lt;code&gt;output_report&lt;/code&gt; function by adding &lt;code&gt;free (banner)&lt;/code&gt;. Then, when running under Valgrind again, it will happily say &lt;code&gt;All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we are clever and see that the code reuses the same banner for each report. So, we define &lt;code&gt;banner&lt;/code&gt; as a static top-level variable in our code and move the &lt;code&gt;create_banner&lt;/code&gt; call to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, so that &lt;code&gt;create_banner&lt;/code&gt;is called only once:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;char *banner; void output_report (int nr) { puts (banner); printf ("Number: %d\n", nr); printf ("\n"); } int main { banner = create_banner (); for (int i = 1; i &amp;#60;= 3; i++) output_report (i); return 0; } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note how we again forget to call &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;, this time at the end of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. Now, when running under Valgrind, Memcheck will report &lt;code&gt;still reachable: 14 bytes in 1 blocks&lt;/code&gt; and zero bytes lost in any other category.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the output offers no details of loss records with backtraces for memory blocks that are still reachable, even though we ran with &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt;. This is because Memcheck thinks the error is not very serious. The memory is still reachable, so the program could still be using it. In theory, you could free it at the end of the program, but all memory is freed at the end of the program anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although still reachable memory isn&amp;#8217;t a real issue in theory, you might still want to look into it. You might want to see whether you could free a given block earlier, which might lower memory usage for longer running programs. Or because you really like to see that statement&lt;code&gt;All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible&lt;/code&gt;. To get the details you need, add &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=reachable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=all&lt;/code&gt; to the Valgrind command line (together with &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt;). Now you will also get backtraces showing where still reachable memory blocks were allocated in your program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Possibly lost&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To explore the other categories of leaks, we change our program a little to include some lists of numbers to report. Each report will have a different list of numbers to report. The complete data structure is allocated at the start of the program. And for each set of numbers, we allocate a new block of numbers. To keep things simple (too simple, as Memcheck will point out) we keep just one pointer to the current numbers struct to be printed. Although we create three sets of numbers, we output only two reports:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;#include &amp;#60;stdlib.h&amp;#62; #include &amp;#60;stdio.h&amp;#62; struct numbers { int n; int *nums; }; int n; struct numbers *numbers; void create_numbers (struct numbers **nrs, int *n) { *n = 3; *nrs = malloc ((sizeof (struct numbers) * 3)); struct numbers *nm = *nrs; for (int i = 0; i &amp;#60; 3; i++) { nm-&amp;#62;n = i + 1; nm-&amp;#62;nums = malloc (sizeof (int) * (i + 1)); for (int j = 0; j &amp;#60; i + 1; j++) nm-&amp;#62;nums[j] = i + j; nm++; } } void output_report () { puts ("numbers"); for (int i = 0; i &amp;#60; numbers-&amp;#62;n; i++) printf ("Number: %d\n", numbers-&amp;#62;nums[i]); printf ("\n"); } int main () { create_numbers (&amp;#38;numbers, &amp;#38;n); for (int i = 0; i &amp;#60; 2; i++) { output_report (); numbers++; } return 0; } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we compile this program with &lt;code&gt;gcc -Wall -g -o possibly possibly.c&lt;/code&gt; and then run it under Valgrind with &lt;code&gt;valgrind --leak-check=full ./possibly&lt;/code&gt;, Valgrind reports &lt;code&gt;possibly lost: 72 bytes in 4 blocks&lt;/code&gt;. And because we ran with &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt;, it also reports the backtraces:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; 24 bytes in 3 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 1 of 2 at 0x4C29F33: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:309) by 0x4011C3: create_numbers (possibly.c:22) by 0x40128F: main (possibly.c:41) 48 bytes in 1 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 2 of 2 at 0x4C29F33: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:309) by 0x401185: create_numbers (possibly.c:17) by 0x40128F: main (possibly.c:41) &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memcheck calls this memory &lt;em&gt;possibly lost&lt;/em&gt; because it can still see how to access the blocks of memory. The &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; pointer points to the third block of numbers. If we kept some extra information, we could theoretically count backward to the beginning of this block of memory and access the rest of the information, or deallocate the whole block and the other memory it points to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Memcheck thinks this is most likely a mistake. And in our example, as in most such cases, Memcheck is right. When walking a data structure without keeping a reference to the structure itself, we can never reuse or free the structure. We should have used the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; pointer as a base and used an (array) index to pass the current record as &lt;code&gt;output_report (&amp;#38;numbers[i])&lt;/code&gt;. Then, Memcheck would have reported the data blocks as still reachable. (There is still a memory leak, but not a severe one, because there is a direct pointer to the memory and it could easily be freed.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Indirectly lost&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the previous example Memcheck reported a possibly lost block because the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; pointer was still pointing inside an allocated block. We might be tempted to fix it by simply clearing the pointer after the &lt;code&gt;output_report&lt;/code&gt; calls by doing &lt;code&gt;numbers = NULL;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that there is no current numbers list to report. But then we have also just lost the last pointer to our memory data blocks. We should have freed the memory first, but we can&amp;#8217;t do it now because we don&amp;#8217;t have a pointer to the start of the data structure anymore:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;int main () { create_numbers (&amp;#38;numbers, &amp;#38;n); for (int i = 0; i &amp;#60; 2; i++) { output_report (); numbers++; } numbers = NULL; return 0; } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Memcheck will report the memory as definitely lost. And because the memory block contained pointers to other memory blocks, those blocks are reported as indirectly lost. If we run with &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt; we see a backtrace for the main numbers memory block:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; 72 (48 direct, 24 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 2 of 2 at 0x4C29F33: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:309) by 0x401185: create_numbers (possibly.c:17) by 0x40128F: main (possibly.c:41) LEAK SUMMARY: definitely lost: 48 bytes in 1 blocks indirectly lost: 24 bytes in 3 blocks possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note how there are no backtraces for the indirectly lost blocks. This is because Memcheck believes you will probably fix that when you fix the definitely lost block. If you do free the definitely lost block, but not the blocks of memory that were indirectly pointed to, next time you run your partially fixed program under Valgrind, Memcheck will report those indirectly lost blocks as definitely lost (and now with a backtrace). So by iteratively fixing the definitely lost memory leaks, you will eventually fix all indirectly lost memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you cannot immediately find the definitely lost block that caused some indirectly lost blocks, it might be informative to see the backtraces for where the indirectly lost blocks were created. When using &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt; you can do that by adding &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=reachable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=all&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt; command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Suppressed&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, Memcheck counts definitely lost and possibly lost blocks as errors with &lt;code&gt;--leak-check=full&lt;/code&gt;. It will also show where those blocks were allocated. It doesn&amp;#8217;t regard indirectly lost blocks or still reachable lost blocks as errors by default. And it won&amp;#8217;t show backtraces for where those still reachable or indirectly lost blocks were allocated, unless explicitly asked to  do so with &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=all&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indirectly lost blocks will disappear (or turn into definitely lost blocks) when you resolve the definitely lost issues. Without definitely lost blocks, there can be no indirectly lost blocks. For reachable blocks, it might still make sense to see whether you can deallocate them early, in order to lower memory usage of your program. Or explicitly free them at the end of your program to make sure all memory is really accounted for and cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there might be reasons for not fixing all memory leaks. They might occur in a library you are using that cannot easily be replaced. Or you might be convinced that a possibly lost block isn&amp;#8217;t really an error. If, in the original definitely lost example, you decide not to fix the issue and to keep the memory leak, you might want to generate a suppression so Memcheck won&amp;#8217;t complain about this particular block again. You can do this easily by running &lt;code&gt;valgrind --leak-check=full --gen-suppressions=all ./definitely&lt;/code&gt; which generates an example suppression:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;{ &lt;em&gt;insert_a_suppression_name_here&lt;/em&gt; Memcheck:Leak match-leak-kinds: definite fun:malloc fun:create_banner fun:output_report fun:main } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can put that into a file (say, &lt;code&gt;local.supp&lt;/code&gt;), replacing &lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;insert_a_suppression_name_here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with something descriptive such as &lt;code&gt;small leak in create_banner&lt;/code&gt;. Now, when you run &lt;code&gt;valgrind --suppressions=./local.supp --leak-check=full ./definitely&lt;/code&gt;, the leak will be suppressed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; LEAK SUMMARY: definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks suppressed: 42 bytes in 3 blocks &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;There won&amp;#8217;t be any more output for any of the suppressed blocks. But if you want to see which suppressions were used, you can add &lt;code&gt;--show-error-list=yes&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt; command line. That option makes Valgrind show the suppression name, suppression file, line number, and how many bytes and blocks were suppressed by that suppression rule:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;used_suppression: 1 small leak in create_banner ./local.supp:2 suppressed: 42 bytes in 3 blocks &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Test suite integration&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you have resolved all memory leak issues, or when you have suppressions for those you don&amp;#8217;t care about, you might want to integrate Valgrind into your test suite to catch any new memory leaks early. If you use &lt;code&gt;--error-exitcode=&amp;#60;number&amp;#62;&lt;/code&gt;, Valgrind will change the program&amp;#8217;s exit code to the given number when an error (memory leak) is detected. You can also use &lt;code&gt;--quiet&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;-q&lt;/code&gt;) to make Valgrind silent, so that it doesn&amp;#8217;t interfere with the normal &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt; of the program, except for error output, so that you can compare the program output as usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember that by default Memcheck regards only definitely lost and possibly lost memory blocks as errors. You can change that by using &lt;code&gt;--errors-for-leak-kinds=&lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you are interested in getting an error only for definitely lost blocks, you can use &lt;code&gt;--errors-for-leak-kinds=definite&lt;/code&gt;. When your test programs always free all memory blocks, including still reachable blocks, you can use &lt;code&gt;--errors-for-leak-kinds=definite,possibly,reachable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--errors-for-leak-kinds=all&lt;/code&gt;. Note that &lt;code&gt;--errors-for-leak-kinds=&lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which works together with &lt;code&gt;--error-exitcode=&lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the above mentioned &lt;code&gt;--show-leak-kinds=&lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt; option, which determines which backtraces to show, are independent. But in general you will want them to be the same, so that you will always get a backtrace for a memory error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, a good way to run your tests is &lt;code&gt;valgrind -q --error-exitcode=99 --leak-check=full ./testprog&lt;/code&gt;. If you have any local suppressions, you can add &lt;code&gt;--suppressions=local.supp&lt;/code&gt;.

This way, Data Grid provides application elasticity, failover across data centers, and a reduced memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common use case for this combination is &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.4/html-single/server_installation_and_configuration_guide/index#crossdc-mode"&gt;cross-datacenter replication mode&lt;/a&gt;, where Red Hat&amp;#8217;s single sign-on (SSO) technology uses Data Grid to replicate data between data centers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To back up data across sites in an &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/welcome-to-the-world-of-xpaas"&gt;xPaaS environment&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/products/openshift/overview"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, the recommended approach is to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_data_grid/8.1/html-single/running_data_grid_on_openshift/index#backup_sites"&gt;deploy Data Grid using the Data Grid Operator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article offers quick instructions for getting Red Hat Data Grid 8.1.1 working with Red Hat&amp;#8217;s single sign-on technology version 7.4.5. The article does not use a full cross-datacenter setup; just a Data Grid server and an SSO client running on OpenShift. We will use the Hot Rod protocol for communication, with both authentication and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: Data Grid can be used as an external cache container for application-specific data. As an external cache, it allows the data layer to scale independently of the application. It also allows different clusters, which may reside in various domains, to access data from the same Data Grid cluster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Setting up the environment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The integration described in this article requires the following technologies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;oc&lt;/code&gt; client on a laptop&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Red Hat&amp;#8217;s single sign-on technology 7.4.5&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Data Grid 8.1.1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;OpenShift 4.6.x&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;To create a project for the integration, run:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ oc new-project &lt;em&gt;project_name&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Setting up Data Grid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install Data Grid 8.1.1 using the Data Grid Operator (see &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_data_grid/8.1/html/running_data_grid_on_openshift/installation#create_olm_subscription"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installing Data Grid Operator on Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for instructions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE infinispan-operator-88d585dd7-xc5xh   1/1     Running   0          58s &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create an Infinispan custom resource (CR) for the cluster and a cache CR for each of the caches you need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Operator makes it easy to deploy Data Grid in a variety of configurations. Once you’ve deployed the Operator from the OpenShift &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/operators/understanding/olm-understanding-operatorhub.html"&gt;OperatorHub&lt;/a&gt;, it exposes custom resources (called Infinispan cluster and Infinispan cache), which Data Grid uses to provision the caches on an existing cluster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To use custom cache definitions along with Data Grid capabilities, such as cross-site replication, we create clusters of Data Grid service nodes. These nodes create an Infinispan cluster using Data Grid as a service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, create an Infinispan cluster from the OpenShift console by going to &lt;b&gt;Installed Operators—&amp;#62;Infinispan Cluster—&amp;#62;Create&lt;/b&gt;. Then, select the &lt;strong&gt;DataGrid&lt;/strong&gt; service type under the &lt;b&gt;Service&lt;/b&gt; field.

The steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clone the templates from GitHub: &lt;pre&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-sso-7-openshift-image&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change to the templates directory: &lt;pre&gt;$ cd redhat-sso-7-openshift-image/templates&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deploy the application with the template using the proper parameters: &lt;pre&gt;$ oc new-app --template=sso74-https -p HTTPS_SECRET="sso-app-secret" -p HTTPS_KEYSTORE="keystore.jks" -p HTTPS_NAME="jboss" -p HTTPS_PASSWORD="redhat" -p JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_SECRET="sso-app-secret" -p JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_KEYSTORE="jgroups.jceks" -p JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_NAME="secret-key" -p JGROUPS_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD="redhat" -p SSO_TRUSTSTORE="truststore.jks" -p SSO_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD="redhat" -p SSO_TRUSTSTORE_SECRET="sso-app-secret"&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go to the directory from which you retrieved the &lt;code&gt;tls.crt&lt;/code&gt; file from &lt;code&gt;rhsso-infinispan-cert-secret&lt;/code&gt; (the secret generated by the Operator) while setting up Data Grid. This certificate will be used for the Hot Rod connection: &lt;pre&gt;$ keytool -importcert -file tls.crt -keystore truststore.jks&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a secret with the truststore file, and add the volume and volume mount entries on the deployment configuration: &lt;pre&gt;$ oc create secret generic truststore-secret --from-file=truststore.jks secret/truststore-secret created $ oc set volume dc/sso --add --name=truststore-secret -m /etc/truststore -t secret --secret-name=truststore-secret --default-mode='0755' &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can navigate on the web console to the secret, click &lt;strong&gt;add secret to workload&lt;/strong&gt;, and fill in the form. After adding the secret as a volume and specifying the path (&lt;code&gt;/etc/truststore&lt;/code&gt;), you will be able to use &lt;code&gt;/etc/truststore/truststore.jks&lt;/code&gt; as the truststore.

If the SSO pod is recreated there is no loss of data and cache entries are retained on Data Grid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat Data Grid is a valuable solution for large data sets across cloud platforms. Data Grid delivers many features for hybrid cloud deployments on OpenShift.

However, engineers have been dealing with conversion issues since &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/"&gt;users started transferring strings from one computer to another&lt;/a&gt;. Today, when more than 95 percent of all web pages use &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629"&gt;UTF-8&lt;/a&gt;, converting data between character sets might seem less relevant. However, it continues to be useful when dealing with legacy data and systems, or with languages where multiple character sets are comparably popular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, using EUC-KR is not unusual on Korean websites because it is more efficient for Korean text. A search engine that indexes Korean sites needs to be able to convert between EUC-KR and UTF-8 to perform the relevant string comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; programming interface provided by POSIX, implemented by its namesake utility program, converts textual data from one character encoding to another. As an engineer on the Red Hat Platform Tools team, I was tasked with finding and fixing bugs reported in the GNU C Library (glibc) &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; utility. In this article, I discuss my experiences with fuzzing &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; and fixing bugs in the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; front end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Error handling in iconv&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A typical &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; program invocation looks like so:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ iconv -f ISO-8859-7 -t UTF-8&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, it is expected to read Latin and Greek text (encoded as ISO/IEC 8859-7) from standard input and write its UTF-8 equivalent to standard output.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While POSIX allows the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; utility to exit with an error when given invalid input, the glibc &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; implementation has an extension that is more tolerant of erroneous input. The user can add a suffix to the destination character set specification to enable &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; features that can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ignore invalid input characters while continuing to process further input.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transliterate input characters without an equivalent in the output character set to a sufficiently similar combination of output characters.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if we wanted to convert UTF-8 encoded Czech text, which uses both diacritics and standard Latin letters, to ASCII, the following invocation would do the trick:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; transliterates the letters with diacritics into their diacritic-free equivalents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;String manipulation in iconv_open&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This extension is probably implemented as a string suffix because the underlying &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; interface is a POSIX standard, and its signature doesn&amp;#8217;t allow for flags or options. Calls to &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; are made with a handler obtained by calling &lt;code&gt;iconv_open&lt;/code&gt;, and with the appropriate conversion source and destination character encoding names. The &lt;code&gt;iconv_open&lt;/code&gt; function has the following signature:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;iconv_t iconv_open (const char *tocode, const char *fromcode);&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, the only meaningful way to extend its functionality without introducing a new interface is to pass option information in one of the string arguments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The glibc &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; implementation recognizes and uses conversion source and destination encodings in the form of a slash-separated triplet:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The first component of the triplet might be an encoding form, which implies a character set.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, it might be a character set where a second component is ideally an encoding form for the underlying character set. If the encoding form is left unspecified, &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; uses a default.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The third component of the triplet is the optional suffix that enables GNU extensions. This means UCS-2// and ISO-10646/UCS-2/ are equivalent.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, because most of the common &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; invocations simply use encoding forms, the second component of the slash-separated specification was forgotten when documenting the interface, and the manual page ended up with the following fragment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Furthermore the GNU C library and the GNU libiconv library support the following two suffixes: //TRANSLIT When the string "//TRANSLIT" is appended to &lt;i&gt;tocode&lt;/i&gt;, transliteration is activated. This means that when a character cannot be represented in the target character set, it can be approximated through one or several similarly looking characters. //IGNORE When the string "//IGNORE" is appended to &lt;i&gt;tocode&lt;/i&gt;, characters that cannot be represented in the target character set will be silently discarded.&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was no clear explanation of the triplet scheme and how multiple suffixes could be passed, which led to the implementation allowing calls such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ iconv -f ISO-8859-7 -t UTF-8//TRANSLIT//IGNORE&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that the missing second component and the resulting &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; were misunderstood as a suffix separator. Based on my reading, this misunderstanding seems to have touched the program code as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Debugging the iconv utility&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ideally, the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; utility program would have avoided supporting options in the form of string suffixes. Instead, it might have supported them only by way of these options, but not in this case. It accepts the same suffixes as the underlying function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, a bug was reported against the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; utility, uncovering a hang when the &lt;code&gt;TRANSLIT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IGNORE&lt;/code&gt; suffixes were used in conjunction with bad input and the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; option. This combination is meant to cause &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; to omit invalid characters in the input from the output, similar to &lt;code&gt;IGNORE&lt;/code&gt;, as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report gathered comments including hints at the possible causes and other similar hangs. I didn&amp;#8217;t make much progress on the report until 2019, when I started looking at it in depth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not knowing much about the internals of the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; interface or utility, I decided to start with a bit of testing. I first wanted to check whether there were hangs in the &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; program other than the one reported. A &amp;#8220;back of the envelope&amp;#8221; calculation led me to conclude that it would take mere days to test every single two-byte input combination for all combinations of program switches and conversions—days that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to spend analyzing or debugging &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One bash script and roughly a week later, I presented the results. There were hangs while converting 165 character sets. Almost all, with the exception of four, occurred when using the option suffixes (&lt;code&gt;TRANSLIT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IGNORE&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; switch, which silenced error messages upon encountering invalid characters. It seemed clear that the problem was general and did not correspond to a bug in a specific character set&amp;#8217;s converter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some debugging, I realized that the option suffixes were handled in string form during the program, instead of being used once to set corresponding flags that are subsequently used exclusively. Bugs in the code led to all but the first option being dropped. This led to hangs when the &lt;code&gt;IGNORE&lt;/code&gt; option was passed after &lt;code&gt;TRANSLIT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fixing this involved a somewhat significant change in &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;s option parsing logic, but once that was &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=91927b7c7643"&gt;fixed&lt;/a&gt;, the hangs vanished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I fixed the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=9a99c682144b"&gt;remaining known hangs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt;. I am finally beginning to feel a bit more comfortable with the codebase. There is still some work to do in glibc&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt; implementation—among other things, improving the manual page. A new interface would also be useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on C and C++, please visit &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/c"&gt;Red Hat&amp;#8217;s topic page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_print" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/print?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Print" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_flipboard" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/flipboard?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" title="Flipboard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F23%2Fsolving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility%2F&amp;#038;title=Solving%20the%20mystery%20of%20hanging%20character%20set%20conversions%20in%20glibc%E2%80%99s%20iconv%20utility" data-a2a-url="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/23/solving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility/" data-a2a-title="Solving the mystery of hanging character set conversions in glibc’s iconv utility"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.addtoany.com/buttons/favicon.png" alt="Share"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/23/solving-the-mystery-of-hanging-character-set-conversions-in-glibcs-iconv-utility/"&gt;Solving the mystery of hanging character set conversions in glibc&amp;#8217;s iconv utility&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jbossbuzz/~4/092iyWe5tDM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Website visitors don&amp;#8217;t typically consider character encoding and conversion when accessing digital content.

This article explores the option of running .NET Framework applications in Windows containers in OpenShift clusters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: This article is part of a series introducing &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/2021/03/16/three-ways-to-containerize-net-applications-on-red-hat-openshift/"&gt;three ways to containerize .NET applications on Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. The previous article introduced &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/2021/04/15/containerize-net-for-red-hat-openshift-linux-containers-and-net-core/"&gt;Linux containers for .NET Core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;span id="more-876847"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Windows containers?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quick history lesson is in order. While &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; containers can trace their origins all the way back to the &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt; system call created in 1979 (Yes, you read that right: Nineteen seventy-nine), the first generally-recognized full implementation of Linux containers began in 2008 with LXC— LinuX Containers. Two LXC implementations, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/warden"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/google/lmctfy"&gt;LMCTFY&lt;/a&gt;, had mild success, but Linux containers really took off with the introduction of Docker in 2013. Following that, issues such as &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/security"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;, scaling, networking, and more, blossomed and continue to improve with age. Linux containers have reached the level of acceptance and maturity such that they are arguably becoming the new standard in software development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows containers were introduced to the .NET ecosystem with the release of Windows Server 2016, allowing developers to build, manage, and treat .NET Framework applications just like Linux containers. Commands such as &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; were identical on Windows and Linux. The only difference was the underlying operating system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat announced general availability (GA) and support for Windows containers in OpenShift in late December 2020. This means—I&amp;#8217;m repeating myself because it is just so amazing—that you can build an image of your .NET Framework application (such as a website running on IIS) on your Windows PC and run it in your OpenShift cluster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is just one consideration: You need a Windows node in your cluster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Running Windows containers in OpenShift&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operations folks, take note: In order to run Windows containers in OpenShift, you&amp;#8217;ll need a cluster that includes a Windows node capable of running Windows containers. That&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;magic sauce&amp;#8221; for running Windows containers in OpenShift. Currently, Windows Server 2019 is the best choice for running Windows containers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers, you have it easy. As a builder of bits, you won&amp;#8217;t really see much difference; you&amp;#8217;ll create your application, build an image, and it will be deployed to OpenShift. A nice thing is that you won&amp;#8217;t have to worry about applications running on the same port. OpenShift is built on Kubernetes, and Kubernetes automagically assigns ports and keeps track of the mapping between what it (Kubernetes) exposes and what your application uses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A recipe for success&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have a cluster capable of running Windows containers, I have created a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/netcandystore"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; (repo) with code and instructions for you to give this exciting technology a go. Until then, you can read and follow along here. Sort of like reading a recipe before you actually make that wonderful dinner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Super awesome bonus material alert: The repo includes instructions, scripts, and data for creating and building a Microsoft SQL Server database &lt;em&gt;inside your OpenShift&lt;/em&gt; cluster, because why not get dessert with dinner?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Building the Windows container image&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To build a Windows container image, we need the following ingredients:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;A compiled .NET Framework application—in this case, a website to run in IIS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A configuration file to build the image, &amp;#8220;Dockerfile,&amp;#8221; that puts everything together&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A command to build the image&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An image registry where we can store the image, which we&amp;#8217;ll eventually pull into our OpenShift cluster&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The compiled application&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re building a website called &amp;#8220;Net Candy Store,&amp;#8221; the MVP (minimal viable project) that our startup needs to get up and running ASAP. At this point, the application is not fully functional, but we want to start building and deploying right away and fine-tune things as we move along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the Git repo I mentioned earlier, we&amp;#8217;ll use the solution (&lt;code&gt;netcandystore.sln&lt;/code&gt;) file in Visual Studio, as shown in Figure 1. Once there, we can use the &lt;b&gt;Publish&lt;/b&gt; option to create the bits needed—the &lt;code&gt;netcandystore.dll&lt;/code&gt; binary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_882287" style="width: 933px" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-882287" class=" size-full wp-image-882287 " data-add-featherlight="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netCandyStore_publish.png" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netCandyStore_publish.png" alt="visual studio publish dialog box" width="923" height="275" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netCandyStore_publish.png 923w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netCandyStore_publish-300x89.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/netCandyStore_publish-768x229.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-882287" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1: The Publish Dialog box in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That Target location is copied and pasted into our image build configuration file, &amp;#8220;Dockerfile.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Dockerfile&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, we need the instructions for the &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; command, which are stored in the file, &amp;#8220;Dockerfile.&amp;#8221; Typically, grammar aside, this is just called &amp;#8220;the Dockerfile,&amp;#8221; so we&amp;#8217;ll continue with that. Here are the contents of the Dockerfile:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;# The `FROM` instruction specifies the base image. You are # extending the `microsoft/aspnet` image. FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8 # The final instruction copies the site you published earlier into the container. COPY ./bin/app.publish/ /inetpub/wwwroot &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, we have just two things to do: Use the base image from Microsoft, and copy our binary to the newly-built image. This is literally the simplest Dockerfile I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A command to build the image&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;With all that in place, we use the &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; command to build the image. For the name and tag of our image, I will use a fully-qualified name that points to the image registry where I&amp;#8217;ll later push the image. The commands I send to OpenShift will pull from that registry. If you use the instructions in &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/donschenck/netcandystore"&gt;the git repo I mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll be using &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://quay.io/repository/donschenck/netcandystore?tag=latest&amp;#38;tab=tags"&gt;the same image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here&amp;#8217;s how to build the Windows container image that will run in OpenShift:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;docker build -t quay.io/donschenck/netcandystore:2021mar8.1 .&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h3&gt;An image registry to store the image&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, after logging into my quay.io account, I can run the following command to make the image registry available:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;docker push quay.io/donschenck/netcandystore:2021mar8.1&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about licensing?&lt;/strong&gt; To put it simply: Licensing relies on the host machine where you are running the containers. You can find more information on &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/faq"&gt;this Microsoft FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deploying the image in your Windows container&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s go time. We are ready to deploy this image to our Windows container host on OpenShift and start enjoying the fruits of our .NET Framework labors. But there&amp;#8217;s a small catch: If you try to deploy to your cluster, the deployment could crash with a timeout error. There&amp;#8217;s a simple workaround, and I&amp;#8217;ve included a sample of it in my Git repo. The trick is to &lt;code&gt;docker pull&lt;/code&gt; the somewhat large Windows server image (5.25 GB) to your cluster&amp;#8217;s Windows node from within the node itself. As a bonus, if you run other Windows containers in your cluster, on the same Windows node, they can use that same server image. In other words, you probably only need to do this &amp;#8220;preload&amp;#8221; once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The details of this step are on my Git repo, so I won&amp;#8217;t repeat them here. The overview is this: Find the name of the Windows node and use SSH to run the &lt;code&gt;docker pull&lt;/code&gt; command inside of it. Once that is done—it takes two or three minutes—the rest is typical OpenShift operations: Create a deployment that points to your application image, an associated service, and a route to publicly expose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: A guide to follow&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to follow a step-by-step guide, including code for a Windows container, an installation of SQL Server on OpenShift, and the installation of a .NET 5 (&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/dotnet"&gt;.NET Core&lt;/a&gt;) application running in a Linux container, follow this repo: &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/netcandystore"&gt;https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/netcandystore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It helps you cover your &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/2019/02/25/full-api-lifecycle-management-a-primer/"&gt;API&amp;#8217;s full lifecycle&lt;/a&gt; by taking your OpenAPI specifications and generating live mocks from them. It can also assert that your API implementation conforms to your OpenAPI specifications. You can deploy Microcks in a wide variety of cloud-native platforms, such as &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/products/openshift/overview"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. Developers who do not have corporate access to a cloud-native platform have used &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt;. Although Docker is still the most popular container option for software packaging and installation, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://podman.io/"&gt;Podman&lt;/a&gt; is gaining traction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Podman was advertised as a drop-in replacement for Docker. Advocates gave the impression that you could issue &lt;code&gt;alias docker=podman&lt;/code&gt; and you would be good to go. The reality is more nuanced, and the community had to work to get proper &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; support in Microcks for Podman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article discusses the barriers to getting Microcks to work with Podman and the design decisions we made to get around them. It includes a brief example of using Podman in rootless mode with Microcks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supporting Podman in Microcks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Podman presented a few design barriers, which the Microcks community had to work around. We&amp;#8217;ll discuss the barriers and how we worked around them, and what those decisions mean for developers using Podman with Microcks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Rootfull or rootless?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Docker requires running a daemon as root, which observers have long criticized as insecure. Podman adopted a very different architecture: It involves no daemon at all and can run as root (rootfull mode) or as a regular user (rootless mode). Microcks supports Podman in either rootfull or rootless mode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although rootless mode looks very appealing, it does not come without cost. Drawbacks include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Containers have no IP address and no DNS aliases.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Port redirection is done in userspace, whereas rootfull mode uses &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables"&gt;iptables&lt;/a&gt;, which is faster.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The overlay storage is done in userspace with &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse"&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt;, which is slower than the traditional &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/overlayfs.html"&gt;overlayFS&lt;/a&gt; mount.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, unless you need high performance or a specific network setup, you can use rootless mode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;DNS aliases: Still in the way&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microcks needs proper DNS aliases in place to work properly. The main reason is that Microcks uses the OpenID Connect protocol for user authentication, which involves both user-facing interactions and server-to-server interactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combined with the quirks and limitations of the other software in the stack (Keycloak, Docker, Podman), this requirement explains why it has always been challenging to get Microcks running without tinkering with the Docker Compose configuration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To work around this issue, the community created a shell script that discovers the current machine IP address and hardcodes that address in the &lt;code&gt;podman-compose&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get DNS aliases working, you need to enable the &lt;code&gt;dnsname&lt;/code&gt; plugin in the default &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt; network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Networking&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the rootfull mode in Podman came another challenge: By default, containers can refer to other containers only by their IP addresses. This command re-creates the default &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt; network and enables the &lt;code&gt;dnsname&lt;/code&gt; plugin:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ sudo podman network rm podman $ sudo podman network create --subnet 10.88.0.0/16 podman &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Using Podman Compose with Microcks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Podman support might not look glorious as presented here, but the benefits of using Podman are worth the effort!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rootless mode is the easiest and safest way to get Microcks working with Podman Compose:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/microcks/microcks.git $ cd microcks/install/podman-compose $ ./run-microcks.sh Running rootless containers... Discovered host IP address: 192.168.3.102 Starting Microcks using podman-compose ... ------------------------------------------ Stop it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity stop Re-launch it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity start Clean everything with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity down ------------------------------------------ Go to https://localhost:8080 - first login with admin/123 Having issues&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; Check you have changed microcks.yml to your platform using podman version: podman version 2.1.1 podman run [...]&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rootfull mode requires that you enable the &lt;code&gt;dnsname&lt;/code&gt; plugin on the default &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt; network, as described earlier. Then, you would just run this script with sudo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting Microcks to work with Podman was not particularly difficult. We hope this support will help you get started with using Microcks in corporate environments.

Then I joined Red Hat around mid-2016 and worked on a project with &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/category/go/"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; for three years. I quickly realized that I wanted something similar to Qt Creator. I’m a regular &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; user, but use it only for plain-text editing and not much more. I gave Vim a shot when really I was looking for something that works out of the box and can still be customized. As usual for a modern project, I needed to be able to do more than edit the files of one programming realm. Enter &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/category/vs-code/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t say that VS Code worked out of the box. But being new to Go, I figured I would give it a try, especially because others were using it. Three years later, in 2019, I needed a change and joined our debuggers group to work on &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://lldb.llvm.org/"&gt;LLDB&lt;/a&gt;, a debugger that is part of the much larger &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://llvm.org/"&gt;LLVM&lt;/a&gt; project. LLVM also hosts &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/category/clang-llvm/"&gt;Clang&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known compiler front-end for C-like languages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I began by checking out the LLVM codebase—which is huge, by the way—and compiling it on my local machine, which was very slow. You can read about my initial endeavor to speed up the compilation in &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/blog/2019/05/15/2-tips-to-make-your-c-projects-compile-3-times-faster/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. To sum things up: A notebook isn’t ideal when you want to code and compile with LLVM. The speed of compilation isn’t the only thing that matters. It’s the linking, as well, that can easily freeze my laptop. That said, distributed compilation using &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/distcc/distcc"&gt;distcc&lt;/a&gt; or similar tools doesn&amp;#8217;t cut it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our group in Red Hat has access to high-powered shared machines in Toronto (e.g., 56 cores with 256 GB of memory). I live in Germany, and at first I was skeptical whether I could successfully use those machines without too much latency. Qt Creator wasn’t a true option for editing files remotely because, as far as I know, it needed to run next to the code it was supposed to compile. After giving Vim and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; another shot for coding and compiling remotely, I went back to VS Code and found out that there’s a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh"&gt;remote SSH extension&lt;/a&gt;. This article navigates you through how I’ve been using VS Code&amp;#8217;s remote SSH extension for editing and compiling LLVM, step by step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My base system is a laptop running the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://getfedora.org/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; 32 operating system. For the sake of this tutorial, we’ll call the remote host just &lt;code&gt;remote-host&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to follow the tutorial step by step, you can put the following into your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; file to create an alias to whatever host you want:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;Host remote-host HostName YOUR_OWN_REMOTE_HOST_GOES_HERE User USER_NAME_WITH_WHICH_YOU_LOGIN_TO_YOUR_REMOTE_HOST&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Replace the obvious bits in that definition. Make sure you can log in to the remote host &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_configuring-key-based-authentication"&gt;without entering a password&lt;/a&gt; by copying the public part of your SSH-key to the remote host: &lt;code&gt;ssh-copy-id remote-host&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Double-check that you can now log in using &lt;code&gt;ssh remote-host&lt;/code&gt;. Now log back out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Setting up VS Code&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, make sure you have a recent copy of VS Code or grab it from &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"&gt;the download site&lt;/a&gt;. Once it&amp;#8217;s installed, you will need a bunch of extensions. To install the extensions I find useful when building and editing LLVM, run this snippet in the command line:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ for i in ms-vscode.cmake-tools \ ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh \ ms-python.python \ ms-vscode.cpptools \ twxs.cmake \ rreverser.llvm \ jakob-erzar.llvm-tablegen \ xaver.clang-format \ pkief.material-icon-theme; do code --install-extension $i; done&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preparing the remote host&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my case, the architecture of the remote host (Fedora 31) and my laptop is the same: x86_64. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if this always needs to be the case. I can confirm that instead of my &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; laptop and Linux remote host, I can use a Mac laptop and a Linux remote host. I&amp;#8217;m sure the same is true for Windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Log in to the remote host with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ ssh remote-host&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your remote host needs to have all the development tools installed that are required to build LLVM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s decide where to download LLVM and refer to it with an environment variable for now. In my case, the directory is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; which would have simplified things a bit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ export MYHOME=/opt/notnfs/kkleine/ # replace this with ~/&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code&gt;$MYHOME&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ cd $MYHOME&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fetch the LLVM source tree:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now create a build directory inside the source directory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ mkdir llvm-project/build&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This directory makes it simpler to find build files within the VS Code IDE later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Firing up VS Code&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you start VS Code, it presents a screen like Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_802397" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47.png"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-802397" class="wp-image-802397 size-large" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47-1024x807.png" alt="VS Code presents a screen full of options at startup." width="640" height="504" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47-1024x807.png 1024w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47-300x236.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47-768x605.png 768w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-from-2020-10-14-16-17-47.png 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-802397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1: The VS Code startup screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice the little green icon in the lower left corner of the screen.

To test this, go to &lt;strong&gt;File—&amp;#62;Open File&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt; and open the main &lt;code&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt; file from the LLVM project that you checked out earlier: &lt;code&gt;/opt/notnfs/kkleine/llvm-project/llvm/CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Installing extensions remotely&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s head over to the extensions by clicking on the extensions symbol, which is a grid of squares. Notice that the side panel shows locally installed extensions and marks some with &lt;strong&gt;Install in SSH: remote-host&lt;/strong&gt;. Click that little green icon to view all the extensions that can be installed on the remote host.

A terminal will open and show results like the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;$ cd /opt/notnfs/kkleine/llvm-project/clang/test/AST ; env /usr/bin/python /home/kkleine/.vscode-server/extensions/ms-python.python-2020.6.91350/pythonFiles/lib/python/debugpy/launcher 44349 -- /opt/notnfs/kkleine/llvm-project/build/bin/llvm-lit ast-dump-decl.c llvm-lit: /opt/notnfs/kkleine/llvm-project/build/bin/../../llvm/utils/lit/lit/llvm/config.py:347: note: using clang: /opt/notnfs/kkleine/llvm-project/build/bin/clang -- Testing: 1 tests, 1 workers -- PASS: Clang :: AST/ast-dump-decl.c (1 of 1) Testing Time: 1.90s Passed: 1&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feel free to run all the tests within the same directory as the current test file by selecting the other launch target, which is called &lt;code&gt;llvm-lit all tests in current dir&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading this article—happy coding!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_print" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/print?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Print" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_button_flipboard" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/flipboard?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#38;linkname=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" title="Flipboard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.redhat.com%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F22%2Fremote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code%2F&amp;#038;title=Remote%20LLVM%20development%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code" data-a2a-url="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/22/remote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code/" data-a2a-title="Remote LLVM development with Visual Studio Code"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.addtoany.com/buttons/favicon.png" alt="Share"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/22/remote-llvm-development-with-visual-studio-code/"&gt;Remote LLVM development with Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jbossbuzz/~4/8EdnrkJqKsQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used the Qt Creator IDE for most of my C++ work in the past.

You don&amp;#8217;t have your place in the free sandbox? Where you can experiment with &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/containers/"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/topics/kubernetes/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="/products/openshift/overview"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;?

But what if you want to run from the command line? The command line is where automation (it&amp;#8217;s scripting, but &amp;#8220;automation&amp;#8221; sounds so much cooler) happens. Building a structure of repeatable actions is, after all, what we developers do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do you get access? This short article will show you. Let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First stop: The OpenShift dashboard&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step is to log into your OpenShift dashboard. Once there, click on the little question mark in the upper right corner (see Figure 1). The menu that appears is the key to unlocking the command line. It also contains links to a world of great information; take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_894567" style="width: 369px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark.png"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-894567" class="wp-image-894567 size-full" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark.png" alt="The OpenShift dashboard menu, with the help icon highlighted." width="359" height="221" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark.png 359w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-894567" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1: The OpenShift dashboard help icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our case, we want to click the &lt;strong&gt;Command Line Tools&lt;/strong&gt; option, shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_894577" style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark_menu.png"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-894577" class="wp-image-894577 size-full" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark_menu.png" alt="The OpenShift Help options menu, with the Command Line Tools option highlighted." width="182" height="347" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark_menu.png 182w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_questionmark_menu-157x300.png 157w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-894577" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 2: The OpenShift Help options menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Command Line Tools&lt;/strong&gt; section of your dashboard is loaded with great tools, and you&amp;#8217;ll want to install some of them (&lt;code&gt;oc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;odo&lt;/code&gt; are must-haves, in my opinion). But right now we will focus on the very first link labeled &lt;strong&gt;Copy Login Command &lt;/strong&gt;(see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_894587" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_tools-page.png"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-894587" class="wp-image-894587" src="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_tools-page.png" alt="The OpenShift command line tools page, with &amp;#34;Copy Login Command&amp;#34; highlighted." width="640" height="514" srcset="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_tools-page.png 953w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_tools-page-300x241.png 300w, https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ds_command_line_tools-page-768x616.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-894587" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 3: The OpenShift command-line tools page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This link opens a new tab in your browser. When prompted to log in, simply click the &lt;strong&gt;DevSandbox&lt;/strong&gt; option. You&amp;#8217;ll land at what appears to be a rather unfinished web page. It&amp;#8217;s not unfinished; it&amp;#8217;s merely kept as simple as possible. You have one option, &lt;strong&gt;Display Token&lt;/strong&gt;, so click on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A token of appreciation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#8217;ve clicked &lt;strong&gt;Display Token&lt;/strong&gt;, your login token will appear, as well as the command you will need to log in (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#8217;ll need to have the &lt;code&gt;oc&lt;/code&gt; command-line tool installed on your machine.

It's focusing on presenting access to ways of mapping successful implementations for specific use cases. It's an interesting challenge creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns. That's very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you're basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you're cutting out the chuff.  What's that mean? It means that it's going to provide you with a way to implement a solution using open source technologies by focusing on the integrations, structures and interactions that actually have been proven to work. What's not included are any vendor promises that you'll find in normal marketing content. Those promised that when it gets down to implementation crunch time, might not fully deliver on their promises. Enter the term Architectural Blueprint.  Let's look at these blueprints, how their created and what value they provide for your solution designs. THE PROCESS The first step is to decide the use case to start with, which in my case had to be linked to a higher level theme that becomes the leading focus. This higher level theme is not quite boiling the ocean, but it's so broad that it's going to require some division in to smaller parts. In this case we've aligned with the higher level theme being 'Retail' use cases, a vertical focus. This breaks down into the following use cases and in no particular order: * * * * * * Real-time stock control * Retail data framework The case we're tackling here is focused on Store Health and Safety. This use case we've defined as the following: Managing effective in-store compliance, health &amp;amp; safety, and employee checks and procedures. The approach taken is to research our existing customers that have implemented solutions in this space, collect their public facing content, research the internal implementation documentation collections from their successful engagements, and where necessary reach out to the field resources involved.  To get an idea of what these blueprints look like, we refer you to the series previously discussed here: * * * * Now on to the task at hand. WHAT'S NEXT The resulting content for this project targets the following three items. * A slide deck of the architectural blueprint for use telling the portfolio solution story. * Generic architectural diagrams providing the general details for the portfolio solution. * A write-up of the portfolio solution in a series that can be used for a customer solution brief. An overview of this series on store health and safety portfolio architecture blueprint: 1. 2. Common architectural elements 3. Example health and safety architecture Catch up on any past articles you missed by following any published links above. Next in this series, taking a look at the generic common architectural elements for the store health and safety architecture.
